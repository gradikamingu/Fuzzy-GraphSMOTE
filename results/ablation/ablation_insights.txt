KEY FINDINGS FOR ARTICLE
================================================================================

1. FUZZY LOGIC CONTRIBUTION: +1.36%
   - Full Fuzzy-GraphSMOTE: 93.81%
   - Without Fuzzy (GraphSMOTE): 92.45%
   - Fuzzy membership labels improve classification significantly

2. GRAPH STRUCTURE CONTRIBUTION: +1.60%
   - Without graph structure → performance drops to 92.21%
   - Graph topology is essential for synthetic node quality

3. PRE-TRAINING CONTRIBUTION: +0.60%
   - Pre-training edge generator improves edge quality
   - Small but consistent improvement

4. OPTIMAL HYPERPARAMETERS:
   - θ = 0.7 (default) is optimal
   - α = 1.0 (default) is near-optimal
   - Small variations have limited impact

CONCLUSION: Both fuzzy logic AND graph structure are essential.
Removing either component significantly degrades performance.
